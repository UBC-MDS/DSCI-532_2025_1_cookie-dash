# Milestone 2 Reflection

Milestone Contributors: Mu (Henry) Ha, Javier Martinez, Stephanie Ta, and Zuer (Rebecca) Zhong

## Implemented Parts of the Proposal and Sketch

We have implemented most of what we proposed:

- The app has a landing page that shows the distribution of cookie recipe ratings as a histogram and the distribution of the different recipe ingredients as a bar chart.
- The number of recipes and average recipe rating are also displayed.
- A user can filter even further by the ingredient subcategories (Flour, Sugar, Fats, Eggs, and Others) by clicking on the buttons. Once doing so, they can filter by specific ingredient from the list of ingredients.
- The list of ingredients will also display the popularity score of the ingredient.
- There is also a slider that will allow the user to filter by their desired recipe rating range.
- Also, there is a list of all of the recipes that match the filters, with their complexity score.

This means that we have implemented 7 inputs (buttons for 5 of the subcategories, specific ingredient filter, and ratings slider) and 5 outputs (the recipe ratings histogram, the number of recipes card, the average rating dial, the number of recipes per ingredient bar chart, and the list of recipes with their complexity). They have been hooked up via callbacks and we would like our work to be considered for the challenging part of this milestone. Each component is informative to the user and ensures that they can easily find recipes that align with their preferences and constraints.

## Non-Implemented Parts of the Proposal and Sketch

We have not implemeted:

- Buttons in which users can filter for basic vs. special ingredient.
- The button to filter for the chocolate cubcategory.
- Showing the popularity rating of each ingredient in the ingredient list.
- Being able to hover over each recipe in the list of recipes that match the filers to see the full recipe and the ingredient proportions via a tooltip.
- Being able to click on the recipe and for a pop-up with the full recipe and the ingredient proportions.

We plan on implementing these in the future.

## Things Done Differently than in the Proposal and Sketch

Instead of buttons with icons for the ingredient subcategories, we have implemented regular buttons due to time constraints and difficulty. We plan on implementing the buttons with icons in the future.
We implemented an additional list of selected ingredients, so that the user can easily track which ones they have filtered for.

## Potential Future Improvements and Additions

At the moment, our dashboard does a good job at displaying overall information about recipes that match the filters that are available. In the future, we would like to finish implementing the rest of the dashboard as specified under "Non-Implemented Parts of the Proposal and Sketch".

## Intentional Deviations from Visualization Best Practices

We have not intentionally deviated from any of the best practices that we learned in 531 regarding effective visualizations.
