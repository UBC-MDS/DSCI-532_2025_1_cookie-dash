## Implemented Parts of the Proposal and Sketch

Clearly document which parts of your proposal/sketch you have implemented in your dashboard so far and explain what is not yet implemented.

## Non-Implemented Parts of the Proposal and Sketch

## Things Done Differently than in the Proposal and Sketch

For anything that you have done differently than in your proposal/sketch explain why (e.g. implementation difficulty, explanation for why the new approach is more effective, etc).

## Non-Working Parts of the Dashboard
Include what you are aware of is not working in your dashboard, so that your TAs can distinguish between features in development and bugs.

Explain if you have intentionally deviated from any of the best practices that we learned in 531 regarding effective visualizations.
